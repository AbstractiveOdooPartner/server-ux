To share a filter among several users you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > User Interface > User-defined Filters*.
#. Edit a filter and fill the field *Available for users* with the desired
   users.
#. The selected users will find the filter available as any other custom filter
   under favorites in the search panel. However only the owner will be able to
   delete the filter.
